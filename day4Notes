IoT Hub v/s Event Hub

IoT hub -> bidirectional communication
									device to cloud AND cloud to device
Events hub-> unidirectional communication 
							either device to cloud OR cloud to device

Device-> anything throwing data at you

IoT Hub can be used in 3 ways:

1. Live Communication
                                1. Connect to events hub
                                2. Connect to service bus (topic/Queue)
                                3. Stream Analytics (SQL for streaming!)
                                4. Databricks (Spark) Structured Stream

2. Stream to (mini) Batch 
                                1. Data lake or Blobs
                                2. SQL or Cosmos 

3. Devices offline?
                                1. Mining robots working underground who come up to the surface once a week!
                                2. IoT Hub can store messages up to 7 days by default or 14 days (in Apache Kafka mode)



2 kinds of firewall/NSG rules:

Inbound: who can talk to my machine
Outbound: who can my machine talk to
