Prerequisites:

1. IoT Hub
2. Data Lake or blob storage

1. Once IoT Hub is created, do two things on left menu:
  A. Devices-> create a new device by entering just the name. Keep other values default. 
  B. Message Routing-> create a new route to Storage Account 

2. Navigate to https://azure-samples.github.io/raspberry-pi-web-simulator/
      On line numbers as following, make appropriate changes:
          A. Line 15: Connection string to what you get from Device.
          B. Line 29: Replace device name to what you created. 
          C. Hit run, and verify that output terminal shows following message
